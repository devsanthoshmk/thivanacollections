Data Handling:

The products are stored in products.json located in the root directory.

Use this product data JSON to populate products dynamically:

{
"<product_id>": {
"discription": "string (product description, includes price, material, policy, hashtags, etc.)",
"images": [
"string (image URL)",
"string (image URL)"
]
},
"<product_id>": {
"discription": "string",
"images": [
...
]
}
}

Parse this JSON into a products store/composable and use it across pages.

Ensure fallback images, proper error handling, and responsive behavior.

Additional Requirements:

Mobile-friendly grid and typography.

Elegant Tailwind color palette (minimal, white/gray with accent).

Reusable Vue components (Navbar.vue, ProductCard.vue, ProductList.vue, Cart.vue, etc.).

Add smooth animations with AOS.

Use Lucide icons for cart, search, social media, and UI elements.

Clean, production-ready code with comments.

Branding:

Brand name: Thivana Collections

Logo: logo.jpg located in the root directory

Goal: Deliver a ready-to-run CSR Vue 3 e-commerce site that looks premium, modern, and elegant, using the above stack, product JSON data, and branding details.
